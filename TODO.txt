TODO:

-fix insufficient material rules: 1 lightsquared bishop now isn't a draw
-finish toFEN() function probably for viewing checkmate positions in excel sheet
-allow switching between current policy rule and epsilon-greedy policy, probably through config
-store first validation cost for each episode as a NN attribute, to better visualize progress

Eventually:

-allow the network freedom to parameterize its own training: namely at least having it
 compute some metric rating its competency, and weight the relative values of material to
 wins/losses accordingly.
-automate hyperparameter optimization: consider having a different network do monte carlo
 sampling over a discrete "grid" of hyperparameter values, then observe the cost data after
 running many episodes of training
