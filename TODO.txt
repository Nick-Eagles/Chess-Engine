TODO:

-Implement a more sophisticated method for determining the network's competency and provide
 a way to relate it back to a suggested value for epsilon used for the EG-policy. Consider
 maybe a normalized dot product of expected vs. received cumulative reward over the set of
 states in a played game: <= 0 would imply complete uncertainty in an average position, and
 1 would be complete certainty
-store first validation cost for each episode as a NN attribute, to better visualize progress

Eventually:

-allow the network freedom to parameterize its own training: namely at least having it
 compute some metric rating its competency, and weight the relative values of material to
 wins/losses accordingly.
